# Acknowledgements

Bactopia is truely a case of *"standing upon the shoulders of giants"*. Nearly
every component of the Bactopia analysis pipeline was created by others and
made freely available to the public.

I would like to personally extend my many thanks and gratitude to the authors
of these software packages. If you've made it this far, I owe you a beer üçª
(or coffee ‚òï!) if we ever encounter one another in person. Really, thank you
very much!
