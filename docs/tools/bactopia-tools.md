# Overview
After Bactopia has completed there are [a lot of output files](output-overview/) about each __individual__ sample. The next step is to take these results and compare samples among each other. To aid in these comparative analyses, a set of predefine workflows, called _Bactopia Tools_, have been created. These workflow leverage the predictable directory structure of Bactopia to automate the mani.

### Available Tools
Below is a list of analyses that are available with `bactopia tools`. To learn more about each _tool_, please follow the link.

__[ani](tools/ani.md)__  
Pairwise average nucleotide identity of sample set  

__[pangenome](tools/pangenome.md)__  
Pan-genome and core-genome phylogeny of sample set  

__[summary](tools/summary.md)__  
Summary overview of a set of samples processed by Bactopia  

### Suggest A Tool
Do you have an idea or suggestion for an analysis that should be added to the set set of Bactopia Tools? If so, please feel free to submit it to [Bactopia GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia/issues)!
