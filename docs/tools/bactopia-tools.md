# Overview
After Bactopia has completed, there will be [a lot of output files](output-overview/) for each __individual__ sample. The next step is to take these results and compare samples between each other. To aid in these comparative analyses, a set of predefined workflows, called _Bactopia Tools_, have been created. These workflows use the predictable directory structure of Bactopia to automate analyses.

### Available Tools
Below is a list of Bactopia Tools currently available. To learn more about each, please follow the link.
