# Overview

Bactopia is an extensive workflow to process Illumina sequencing for bacterial genomes. The goal of Bactopia is process your data with a broad set of tools, so that you can get to the fun part of analyses quicker! Bactopia prioritizes software available from [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) (or other
[Anaconda channels](https://anaconda.org/)) to make setup easier. The Bactopia workflow is managed by [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), allowing for support of many types of environments (e.g. cluster or cloud).
