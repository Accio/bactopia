# Overview

Bactopia is an exstensive workflow to process Illumina sequencing for bacterial genomes. The goal of Bactopia is process your data with a broad set of tools, so that you can get to the fun part of analyses quicker! Bactopia prioritizes software available from [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) (or other
[Anaconda channels](https://anaconda.org/)) to make installation and setup easier. The Bactopia workflow is also encapsulated as a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow to allow support for many types of environments (e.g. cluster or cloud).
