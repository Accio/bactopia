# About Bactopia
We initially released [Staphopia](https://staphopia.emory.edu/) in the summer
of 2018, for the analysis of *Staphylococcus aureus* genomes. At conferences,
or via email, the most common question about Staphopia that we received was:

*"How can I use Staphopia for my bacteria of interest?"*.

We too, have always been interested in this, because we also work with other
bacteria and would like a standard pipeline for incoming sequencing. Given the
self-interest and community interest, we developed Bactopia, *a generic pipeline
for the analysis of short-read bacterial sequences*! Side-note... we
kept the *"-opia"* in the name to pay homage to Staphopia!

While the philosophy behind Staphopia and Bactopia is mostly the same. The
development of Bactopia from scratch has really allowed us to take what we
learned from Staphopia and use it to our advantage. Bactopia has been developed
with usability, portability, and speed in mind.

Bactopia uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage the workflow. We
have also prioritized software packages available from
[Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) (or other
[Anaconda channels](https://anaconda.org/)) to make installation
as simple as possible for users. Finally, we have updated our workflow to
include the latest methods.
